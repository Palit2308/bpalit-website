Recently started exploring album style music and sort of just doing rock the right way sort of. I mean i dont know if it makes sense, but I had listened to a lot of music here and there. For example, pink floyd here and there, you know? the big hits, or the big tracks. Comfortably numb, Wish you were here, Time, Money, Another Brick, etc. Dire Straits only Sultans, Metallica here and there, rhcp, top songs, etc. You get the point. 

But it just felt a bit uncomfortable, empty somehow, as if i enjoy some music, but dont know most of it. So after a discussion with ChatGPT I started listening to some albums. I started with Powerslave of Iron Maiden. And Lateralus by Tool. Then did the Dire Straits album by Dire Straits. By that time, was hooked. Its as if listening to a full 40 minutes composition rather than a single track. Did Pink floyd, Meddle, Dark side, Wish you were here, Animals, Wall. Then shifted to Dire Straits. That changed something. 

I am totally hooked to all of Dire Straits albums. From dire straits, to every street. All the albums in between. Might be a conroversial opinion, but I like Communique better than Brothers in Arms. Single Handed Sailor is where Knopfler peaked I think. It's even better than Sultans of Swing. And that whole album, I can listen to it all day. currently I am listening to more of Knopfler, like Sailing to Philadelphia, and his source code (like chatgpt says), JJ Cale. A good blues influence here. But album storytelling is also explored in Iron Maiden, Tool, Gojira, Floyd albums. I want to explore that side as well. For Maiden I think I will start Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. Oh Tool I have heard 3 albums, Lateralus, 10K days and AENima. Tough to sit through, but great payoff. I think i might do the Black Album by mettalica and Master of Puppets and see where it takes me. 

Now I feel better because I am really trying to understand the ways it evolved over time. I will eventually delve more into Zepplin, Sabbath, Deep Purpple beyond their hits, but seems like I am not there yet. Let's see.
